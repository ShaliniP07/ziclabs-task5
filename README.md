## Author: Shalini P
## Batch: (1 November- 30 November,2023)
## Domain: 
JAVA Programming
## Aim: 
To build a Address Book System
## Description/Working of code:
1. In this code, a Contact class is defined to store individual contact details. The class has attributes like name, phone number, email address, and other relevant details.

2. An AddressBook class is defined to manage the collection of contacts. It has methods like addContact, removeContact, searchContact, and displayContacts to manipulate the contacts data.

3. The code provides a simple graphical user interface for the Address Book System. It displays options for adding, editing, searching, and displaying contacts.

4. Methods to read and write contact data are implemented in the AddressBook class. These methods are responsible for saving the contacts data to a file and loading the data from the file when the application starts.

5. Input validation is implemented to ensure that required fields are not left empty and that the contact data is in the correct format. Additionally, exception handling is used to catch any errors that may occur during the execution of the application.

6. Overall, this code provides a basic implementation of an Address Book System in Java. It demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming principles and how to implement input validation and exception handling.
